Objects and Classes
Complete the following exercises by the due date.   Make sure your source code using appropriate programming style (e.g., descriptive variable names, indenting, comments, etc.).

Exercises:

1.	Write a class for time objects that store three integer values for hour, minute, and second.  Also, write a program to test the functionality of your class.  Make sure it does all of the following:

•	Create time objects with no values (default)
•	Create time objects with all three values (hours, minutes, seconds)
•	Create time objects with only hours and minutes
•	Change hours, minutes, and seconds independently
•	Change time (all three values)
•	Display military time
•	Display standard time

2.	Define a class for an elevator that only services three floors.  Your class must store variables for CurrentFloor (int), GoingUp (bool), and GoingDown (bool).  Write a default constructor function for the class and two member functions: goUp() and goDown().  Write an elevator test program.  
Have the program execute the following steps using the methods in the class:

•	Start on the first floor. 
•	Go to the second floor (don’t forget to update the Boolean variable GoingUp).
•	Go to the third floor
•	Go to the fourth floor (or at least try to)
•	Go back to the second floor
•	Go back to the first floor
